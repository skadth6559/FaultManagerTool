Option 1: Store Fault Resets in Failsafes Table
	- Store additional columns for fault resets in same table as failsafes
	- Requires a flag to indicate whether an entry in this table is a fault reset
	- If flag is true, then only display the columns in the table that are relevant to a fault reset (this view page is currently a mockup and has not been implemented)
	- If flag is false, then display columns relevant to a failsafe which would be the page currently being shown for viewing failsafes


Option 2: Store Fault Resets in a separate table for each version
	- Create a table with only the fields listed above with suffix "_fault_resets" (similar to the other tables for each release)
